# Gastronomy UPLC Debugger

Smart contracts on Cardano tend to be very small, so this UPLC Debugger stores the state of the machine at every step of execution; giving the ability to then step forward and backward with ease, and present a nice user interface for doing so.

## Quick Start

```sh
gastronomy run test_data/fibonacci.uplc 03
```
