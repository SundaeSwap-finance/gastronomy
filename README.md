<h1>UPLC Debugger</h1>

<p>Smart contracts on Cardano tend to be very small, so the goal would be to take an existing implementation of the UPLC emulator and modify it so it stores the state of the machine at every step of execution; we could then step forward and backward with ease, and present a nice user interface for doing so. </p>
